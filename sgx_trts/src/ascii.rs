//! Operations on ASCII strings and characters.
//!
//! Most string operations in Rust act on UTF-8 strings. However, at times it
//! makes more sense to only consider the ASCII character set for a specific
//! operation.
//!
//! The [`AsciiExt`] trait provides methods that allow for character
//! operations that only act on the ASCII subset and leave non-ASCII characters
//! alone.
//!
//! The [`escape_default`] function provides an iterator over the bytes of an
//! escaped version of the character given.
//!
//! [`AsciiExt`]: trait.AsciiExt.html
//! [`escape_default`]: fn.escape_default.html
