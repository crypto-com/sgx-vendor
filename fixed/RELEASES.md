  * Conversions to/from `bf16` are now provided when the `f16` option
    is enabled.

    `saturating_add`, `saturating_sub`, `saturating_mul_int`,
    `saturating_abs`
  * Support for casts using the *az* crate was added.

Version 0.4.5 (2019-08-30)
==========================

  * Bug fix: display of many decimal numbers was panicking in debug
    mode or including a leading zero in release mode.
  * Many methods were added to `Wrapping` for convenience, even if
    they do not involve wrapping.

Version 0.4.4 (2019-08-24)
==========================

  * Bug fix: rounding could produce bad output for `Binary`, `Octal`,
    `LowerHex` and `UpperHex`.

Version 0.4.3 (2019-08-20)
==========================

  * The *fixed* crate now requires rustc version 1.34.0 or later.
  * The precision argument is no longer ignored when formatting
    fixed-point numbers; precision should now be handled the same as
    for primitive floating-point numbers in the standard library.
  * Parsing strings now rounds to the nearest with ties rounded to
    even.
  * Checked versions of string parsing methods are now available as
    inherent methods to all fixed-point numbers, and as methods in the
    `Fixed` trait.
  * `Wrapping` now has methods for parsing with wrapping, including
    an implementation of `FromStr`.
  * The following methods are now `const` functions:
      * `min_value`, `max_value`, `from_bits`, `to_bits`
      * `count_ones`, `count_zeros`, `leading_zeros`, `trailing_zeros`
        `rotate_left`, `rotate_right`
      * `wrapping_neg`, `wrapping_add`, `wrapping_sub`,
        `wrapping_mul_int`, `wrapping_shl`, `wrapping_shr`

        `overflowing_mul_int`, `overflowing_shl`, `overflowing_shr`
      * `is_positive`, `is_negative`
  * The associated constants `INT_NBITS` and `FRAC_NBITS` were added.
  * The reexports in the `frac` module and the `LeEqU*` traits were
    moved into the new `types::extra` module.

Version 0.4.2 (2019-08-16)

    deprecated.
  * The new method [`from_num`][`Wrapping::from_num`] was added to the
    [`Wrapping`] wrapper.
  * Bug fix: parsing of decimal fractions was fixed to give correctly
    rounded results for long decimal fraction strings, for example
    with four fractional bits, 0.96874999… (just below 31⁄32) and
    0.96875 (31⁄32) are now parsed correctly as 0.9375 (15⁄16) and 1.0.

Version 0.4.1 (2019-08-12)
==========================

  * All fixed-point types now implement `FromStr`.
  * The methods `from_str_binary`, `from_str_octal` and `from_str_hex`
    were added.

Version 0.4.0 (2019-08-08)
==========================

  * The *fixed* crate now requires rustc version 1.31.0 or later.
  * The `traits` module was added, with its traits `Fixed`,
    `FixedSigned`, `FixedUnsigned`, `FromFixed`, `ToFixed`,
    `LossyFrom` and `LossyInto`.
  * The `saturating_neg` method was added to all fixed-point numbers,
    and the `saturating_abs` method was added to signed fixed-point
    numbers.
  * The `consts` module was added.
  * The `signum` method now wraps instead of panics in release mode.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

  * The sealed traits `Int` and `Float` now have no provided methods;
    the methods in the old implementation are now provided by
    `FromFixed` and `ToFixed`.
  * Deprecated methods were removed.
